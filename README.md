This is an enhanced version of [ai-login](https://github.com/ocueye2/ai-login) by ocueye2.

It utilizes the GPT-4o-mini model, which is hosted by Github on Azure through GitHub Models.

### No OpenAI Account Required
To use this, you only need a GitHub API Key. Set it as the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

<small>Struggling with the algorithms? Set the environment variable `AILOGIN_DEBUG` to `1` to make things easier.</small>
